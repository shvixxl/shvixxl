# Software Engineer ☕️

Looking for a passionate developer for your project? It's me! I love designing and implementing new things that can help people, and my 4+ years of hands-on experience are helping me do this! 🚀

- 📚 I feel confident working with high-load cloud-based distributed systems.
- 🏗️ I can build complex applications while keeping architecture simple to maintain.
- 💸 But I can't let you lose money due to unoptimised workflows and performance!

And if you need something fresh in your team, then I can bake y'all some delicious vegan cookies, sing a happy song, and even run D&D evenings! 🌈
