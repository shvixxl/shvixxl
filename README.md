# Software Engineer ðŸŒˆ Open to Your Ideas

I love designing and implementing new things that can help people, and my years of hands-on experience are helping me do this! ðŸš€

- I feel confident working with high-load cloud-based distributed systems.
- I can build complex applications while keeping architecture simple to maintain.
- But I can't let you lose money due to unoptimised workflows and performance!

And if you need something fresh in your team, then I can bake y'all some delicious vegan cookies, sing a happy song, and even run D&D evenings! ðŸŒˆ
